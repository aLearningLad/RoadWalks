# 🚶Road Walks

## For soccer pre season, boxers' road work, triathletes, competitive marathoners & casual running clubs. 
Written in C#, it uses the repository pattern to decouple Domain models, DTOs and database contexts from one another, making controllers neater and easier to maintain and expand upon. This API is built to provide richly detailed running routes with landmarks, places to rest, multiple segues and more.
